Primary human cells cultured in 3D organoid format have great promise as potential regenerative cellular therapies, but their immunogenicity has not yet been fully characterized. In this study, we use in vitro co-cultures and in vivo humanized mouse experimental models to examine the human immune response to autologous and allogeneic primary cholangiocyte organoids (PCOs). Our data demonstrate that PCOs upregulate the expression of HLA-I and HLA-II in inflammatory conditions. The immune response to allogeneic PCOs is driven by both HLA-I and HLA-II and is substantially ameliorated by donor-recipient HLA matching. Autologous PCOs induce a low-level immune infiltration into the graft site, while allogeneic cells display evolving stages of immune rejection in vivo. Our findings have important implications for the design and clinical translation of autologous and allogeneic organoid cellular therapies.
