The human dataset in GenAge is a curated database of genes that may regulate human ageing or that at least might be considerably associated with the human ageing phenotype. It is a functional genomics database designed to provide up-to-date information in the context of ageing and molecular genetics.

Because our focus is on the fundamental ageing process, what some authors call senescence, and not just age-related pathologies, the human dataset features primarily genes related to biological ageing rather than genes that only affect longevity by having an impact on overall health. This is an important point because longevity can be influenced by factors unrelated to ageing, and the distinction is crucial, albeit often difficult. (For those interested in genes associated with human longevity, please refer to the LongevityMap). Likewise, a gene being differentially expressed during ageing is not by itself proof that this gene is causally involved in the ageing process. Nonetheless, for researchers studying transcriptional changes with age, also available are genes commonly differentially expressed during mammalian ageing which were identified by performing a meta-analysis of ageing microarray data.
