The dataset of genes associated with longevity or ageing in model organisms is essentially a list of genes with one or a few key references, a brief description of the phenotype or effects of genetic manipulations of the gene, human homologues of the gene, and a few external links. For a gene to be featured, its association with ageing and/or longevity must be unambigous, and hence most genes were selected based on genetic manipulations and not mere correlations, such as a gene's upregulation with age, in which causality is impossible to determine.
